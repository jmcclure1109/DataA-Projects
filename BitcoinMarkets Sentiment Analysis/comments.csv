There are actually people starting to take interest in cryptocurrency, rather than just the same die-hard traders going back and forth with the same coins.\n\nThe next big thing I'm watching for will be whether the floor price for the Bored Ape Yacht Club and other big NFT collections starts to go up.

BitcoinMarkets,iub2rp0,yg9cyo,"There are a few problems with looking at cycles this way.  Here are two which are obvious:\n\n1: Halving to halving cycles aren't exactly 4 years long.\n\nBitcoin was launched on January 3rd, 2009.    \n1st halving: November 28th, 2012    \n2nd halving: July 9th, 2016    \n3rd halving: May 11th, 2020\n\nIt's estimated the next halving will be in March 2024 based on the average difficulty of mining blocks, but only time will tell.\n\nSo, you can't lay year on top of year to look at averages, nor can you lay cycle on top of cycle.  The dates don't line up.\n\n2: The buyers have been different for each era, so the underlying causes of price action will be different for each era.\n\nIn the beginning, the buyers were old-school crypto enthusiasts (meaning people who were enthusiastic about cryptocurrency before what we know as crypto even existed).  They were buying Bitcoin for under $1.  Next came the early hobbyists, buying Bitcoin for under $10.  Then came the early gamblers, buying Bitcoin for under $100.  Then came the early investors, buying Bitcoin for under $1,000.  Then came the early institutions, buying Bitcoin for under $10,000.\n\nEvery single one of those jumps in price brought in a new wave of buyers, and a new kind of buyers.  I feel like we're in the era of early mainstream buyers now, but I emphasize the word Early.  I'm talking about mainstream institutions, mainstream investors, mainstream gamblers, mainstream hobbyists, mainstream enthusiasts, etc.  We're in the early stage of Bitcoin going mainstream.\n\nI know some of you will read that and think ""Bitcoin is already mainstream!""  People who are early almost always overestimate how common something is.\n\nBitcoin is as mainstream today as the internet was in the mid 90s.  A decade from now, we'll look back on this era and realize how early we really were.\n\nWhen Bitcoin truly goes mainstream, especially in terms of institutions buying in to build their long term positions, we'll see the market really rocket skyward.  I think we're still a few years away from that, but not many.  I wouldn't be surprised at all if it begins in 2024/2025.\n\n...Food for thought.",1667086074,t1_iuabu30,/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/yg9cyo/daily_discussion_saturday_october_29_2022/iub2rp0/

BitcoinMarkets,iud5ert,yg9cyo,"I agree bitcoins underlying data structure is quisi-periodicity, which, like you said, is noticeable in network fundamental features and volatility features. Probably due to bitcoins price being largely driven by demand and sentiment: particularly in the number of users on the network/transactional data & hash rate/mining revenue (as miners tend to battle around the block halving). So the fundamentals describe the quisi-periodic sentiment cycles in cryptocurrency. \n\nThat's why I personally think that network fundamentas is equally as important as volatility and volume. While this style of data analysis is very hard for discretionary traders to use as a prediction model (as some use NVT, MVRV, etc. as signals), there is much room for ML to analyse the quisiperiodic nature of the data structure. Think, some metrics such as volume momentum & NVT have a cyclic data structure, which can essentially be thresholded to describe regime changes. This is just a decision tree, and I believe ML ensembles perform best in quisi-periodic data sets as they can automatically detect regime changes, because fundamental features will eventually match previous conditions unless there has been a structural break in the data set (much like factor models can predict major corrections in US large caps for the same reason, i.e. think fundamentals such as shiller ratio, div yield, book/market correlation features such as interest rates & inflation (i.e. structural breaks during stagflation periods), and the rest. \n\nIts a little harder for a single trader to process all of this information consistently in real-time, but ML ensembles (such as gradient boosted trees) certainly have the capability to do it. So although the data structure in quisi-periodic, it is still repetitive. \n\nI think we are yet to see a total structural break in BTCs data, but that will be stress tested as the recession looms over the next 12 months (I believe the macro risks rn will probably lengthen the crypto winter).  However, we won't know if a lengthening actually becomes a structural break until much further into/after the recession.",1667134694,t1_iub2rp0,/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/yg9cyo/daily_discussion_saturday_october_29_2022/iud5ert/

Considering FTX's size and reputation, this is far worse than Luna/UST, Celsius, 3AC, Voyager, etc. The question now is how far does the FTX contagion go? Who else is wrapped up in this? That's what the market is trying to gauge now, and the uncertainty is destroying prices and confidence.\n2. FTT and SOL. FTT down 95%, likely not long until it gets to $0. SOL also totally wrecked, down 95% as well. Even aside from price, I'm not sure Solana is going to make it out of this given how much FTX/SBF propped them up. The big question here is if they are tied into this somehow as well, and how much SBF/FTX or others in the contagion have propped them up.\n3. Confidence & trust. This is going to scare away potential investors for years to come or possibly longer. Not to mention that the chances of reactive/over-extended regulation are now higher, which could set the space back. Very hard to see how this part will play out.\n\n**Winners? Sort of?**\n\n1. DeFi.

But in BTC terms it’s very likely you will never recoup your initial investment if it will take you a few years to recoup that investment amount in dollar terms as the price of BTC is likely to be much more than what you initially sold it for by the time you recoup your total initial investment amount in dollar terms.\n\nEvery TradFi asset imaginable is vastly overpriced in BTC terms right now. For instance in the United States alone there are approximately 84 million single family homes right now. There is an absolute maximum of 21 million BTC which will ever exist. If BTC ultimately becomes the global unit of account the maximum amount the median home price in America could possibly be is much lower than 0.25 BTC since there’s way more than 84 million homes globally and there’s many other assets in the world aside from housing to account for.",1667353522,t1_iupdy0p,/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/yiy5rq/daily_discussion_tuesday_november_01_2022/iuphg2l/

In order to expedite that process you should do whatever you can to increase your earned income whether that means mastering a new skill or getting promoted or starting a side hustle. You should also do whatever you can to minimize your expenses within reason as much as possible.\n\nWhen it comes to passive income sources you’re thinking in fiat terms. The opportunity cost of using money to buy a passive income stream is less money to instead buy BTC with. If/when BTC becomes unit of account in the future and nobody is using fiat any longer to transact, game theory dynamics behind investing change massively. The primary reason why investing is important in our current system is because of the fact that fiat is printed into infinity so if you don’t invest your fiat into relatively scarce assets you will lose purchasing power over time. That dynamic drastically changes in a world where the unit of account itself is absolutely scarce; you would be able to save in the unit of account without needing to invest in other assets since that unit of account would retain purchasing power long-term.",1667365413,t1_iuq1a23,/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/yiy5rq/daily_discussion_tuesday_november_01_2022/iuq4cyb/

BitcoinMarkets,iutgw28,yjuv4k,You’re correct. The only potentially bearish aspect of what was said is that the terminal rate the Fed reaches sometime next year may need to be higher than what was previously anticipated. But they did in fact open up to the possibility of a 50 BP rate hike in December rather than 75 BP even if inflation remains high.\n\nWhat’s likely to occur is they’re going to wait and see the CPI numbers for October and November before deciding how they’ll proceed with rate hikes in December’s meeting. YoY CPI for September came in at 8.2%. As long as CPI continues to trend down from its peak they’re more likely to proceed with the 50 BP rate hike even if the continued downtrend is minor (for example October CPI comes in at 8.1% and then November CPI comes in at 7.9 or 8%). If CPI suddenly stops trending down and remains stuck or rises slightly then they’ll go with a 75 BP rate hike in December.,1667426751,t1_iutew1s,/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/yjuv4k/daily_discussion_wednesday_november_02_2022/iutgw28/

BitcoinMarkets,iv71smv,ymjjf6,"Had a short from 20.8 before FOMC, closed it around 20.4 for a very small gain before the FOMC whipsaw, not the move I was looking for. Tempted to fade 21.5, but it's getting harder to find clear invalidation points.\n\nBig picture, I'm starting to feel more comfortable buying back some of my spot bags. I need to think on it a bit, but I'm starting to feel more uncomfortable not owning much btc than I would holding it through another \~35% drop.\n\nI lost a lot of money on some non-crypto speculative bets this year, which has definitely impacted my willingness to stomach a drawdown. That said, I think I might put in somewhere around a third of my available capital in soon. If we start trending up, I won't be locked out of buying back my original position and then some, if we drop hard I'll be able to get significantly more btc than I started last cycle with.\n\nCaveats - \n\nbtc has a double bearish OBV divergence within a rising wedge. Last time that happened, we nuked from 25 to 18.5. That said this divergence is way shallower and the wedge a little looser - chart here: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/pR5bALk7/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/pR5bALk7/) \n\nmacro still shitty, but every day we get closer to the fed slowing their hikes, and there's no reason crypto can't bottom first\n\nI'm bull-posting after a pump which probably means dump incoming.\n\nTLDR: Going to partially fill spot bags soon to hedge against a lockout move.

BitcoinMarkets,iv7pats,ymjjf6,"BTC is now trending over the 20 week moving average in a period of low volatility constriction around Bollinger Bands.  I’ve marked off all periods of this setup back to 2015, and every single one of them progressed into an upside move.  In some cases the upside move was constrained, and in others it marked the end of the bear market. \n\nI personally think we’re in some middle phase whereby BTC moves back to test prior local high at $25k and then markets make some larger decision about direction.  If I’m to guess, $25k will provide a lot of friction (assuming it gets there).\n\nIf general markets move into not just a big equity correction, but a full on recession (unlike any crypto period prior), then I think we can see new lows in 2023.  If, instead, cheap money on the part of central banks resumes, then we’re likely at the cycle lows.\n\nI’ll leave it to the speculators to decide the route.  But I’m feeling more confident now we see some uptrend over next couple months to retest rather than another big nuke in the shorter term.\n\nTL:DR - I’m now betting on $25k by EOY and then some larger decision on direction. \n\n[Chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/GchSxo0x/)",1667689730,t3_ymjjf6,/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/ymjjf6/daily_discussion_saturday_november_05_2022/iv7pats/

BitcoinMarkets,iv7uc31,ymjjf6,"We’re seeing some divergence locally between crypto and general markets.  If we zoom [WAY out on the money SPY](https://www.tradingview.com/x/2XHlcRee/), we can see price hitting some supports around monthly 50MA.  If you bring up the [weekly chart with SPY](https://www.tradingview.com/x/b361smdu/) it’s also finding ground support around 200MA.   I personally think this support holds till EOY disregarding a black swan.\n\nWhile the FED remains steadfast in rate hikes and sustaining them to curb inflation, I suspect tradfi can continue to move down.  And so, in this scenario, we might assume crypto follows so long as these markets remain correlated.  To your point, they’ve diverged recently .. but I’m still suspect of this divergence holding if global markets get a nuke.   If BTC holds in this context then it’d send some large signal for the ‘safe’ trade and we may see BTC fly as investors scramble to reallocate capital. \n\nIn my view, on the SPY, price trending under the 200MA weekly would be very bearish and suggest another larger leg down.  I’m now of the opinion that the FED will not pivot until unemployment rises.  This should first be coupled with lower earnings into next year and perhaps further draw downs in equities.  How crypto fairs us up for debate.  Part of this whole phase is more around central banking policy than any other recession prior in my own view. \n\nI do not believe the FED can sustain interest rate hikes for very long before being forced back into QE in some form or another due to the extreme debt to GDP … the question in my mind is ‘wen’.  It seems to me like all markets in this interstitial are watching central banks for signal .. free markets have taken some back seat to central policy.",1667691948,t1_iv7rytj,/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/ymjjf6/daily_discussion_saturday_november_05_2022/iv7uc31/

Imminent layoffs across the country. Elite engineers at even FAANG are about to be let go: those with high paying jobs who have taken on higher debt obligations because they thought this gravy train would never end — foreclosures galore by end of next year. \n\nI’m in group chats where the panic is turning into anger and they’re looking for someone to blame. This is going to be historic: fellow engineers are now recognizing the mistakes central banks made to bail out failed corporations by buying their junk securities, flooding the economy with PPP loans, Biden’s spending, and of course all at zero rates. Now the middle class is left with the bill, with no jobs, and their yuppie “elite” lifestyle will soon be no more.\n\nThese are upper middle class people who put their trust and faith (banking their retirement) into the system, the same individuals who wouldn’t ever touch financial instruments outside of TradFi, only to have it taken away in a span of months. The resulting devastation, anger, and resentment towards the government and central banks will manifest into a financial rebellion/renaissance and I hope Bitcoin will be the primary proxy for this revolution.

BitcoinMarkets,ivjejrk,ypbpf1,"Alameda Research is more likely than not to go bankrupt at this point, but FTX is a different company than Alameda.  FTX has an actual business model that makes money through something other than trading and investing, and nobody has yet to provide evidence that FTX is having financial difficulties.  FTX does not own Alameda, so the exchange itself is not at risk.  Don't believe random posts where people are claiming to have ""withdrawal problems"" and trying to create a run on FTX.\n\nThe core issue in the coming days is going to be how orderly the margin calls and liquidations for Alameda (not FTX) can be processed.  From what I've heard so far, all of the lenders' loans to Alameda are overcollateralized.  Undoubtedly, some of the collateral is bitcoins.  The big lenders are probably going to be able to get rid of those bitcoins without losses.\n\nThe bigger concern is going to be the margin calls to others that follow when bitcoins hit $17,000, $15,000, and so on.  We don't know whether the lenders are going to be able to get 100% of the collateral from those secondary borrowers back at that point.  I hope that there is enough buy pressure to allow for an orderly liquidation of all the people who have nothing to do with Alameda but just happened to find themselves caught up in the crash as Alameda's assets are liquidated.  The speed at which the bitcoin crash unfolds is going to be key as to how many companies survive this crash.\n\nI sold 2 more this morning at $19,700 to pay for taxes, as I can't afford taking the risk of seeing whether or not there will be enough buyers.  It seems extremely unlikely that $17,000 is going to hold up unless a miracle occurs at Alameda.\n\nWhat's weird about all of this is that there actually was no issue at all just three days ago.  The market was perfectly fine with FTT token being valued at the price it was.  This entire situation is being driven solely by market sentiment.  There has been no actual change in conditions at any company compared to the weekend, which is amazing.",1667910057,t3_ypbpf1,/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/ypbpf1/daily_discussion_tuesday_november_08_2022/ivjejrk/

BitcoinMarkets,ivml6gy,ypbpf1,"Leveraged billionaires win my attention today for sure. I’ve been reading though and SBF might not have been lying that they don’t invest client assets. The problem could just be leverage on the platform itself becoming the issue during a bank run. Because if user A deposits $1000 of USDC into FTX Earn and they lend that $1000 to user B to go 2X long on BTC and now there’s a bank run where user A wants their $1000 back…think about what happens. FTX cannot repay user A the $1000 they put into FTX earn without liquidating user B.\n\nNow during normal times it doesn’t matter that they’ve lent customer assets to other customers to use for a leveraged position. But if there’s a run on their exchange then they’re forced to either liquidate every single leveraged position on their platform (killing it forever) to pay out the users who were lending (whether via ftx earn or by selecting lending) or to scramble for a savior who can float them the extra capital to cover the remaining positions.\n\nBasically FTX may have just not have built up the additional capital cushion they should have to offer that much leverage to everyone. Most likely they never accounted for this bank run scenario. This also explains why there weren’t many cold wallet funds seen either, your assets are mostly just lent to another user for their long or short position on ftx.\n\nI’m really curious to see how this ends up playing out with Binance now. Will they basically unwind or limit the leverage that made FTX so popular?\n\nFTX also recently capped their earn limit to $100K so I wonder if them doing that also caused a lot of whales to pull funds off which may have left them with tons of leveraged positions but no lenders.",1667957627,t1_ivmighy,/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/ypbpf1/daily_discussion_tuesday_november_08_2022/ivml6gy/

What matters though is market perception, and of course right now this is all very bad PR for FTX and SBF. \n\nPersonally, I’m fascinated by these battles and very curious to see how it plays out. A few thoughts going forward:\n\n1. The irony of people defending CZ and Binance as some trustworthy savior out to defend crypto is comical. Binance has always been a shady and untrustworthy exchange, hence the “shitcoin casino” nickname it used to have (still does?)- they went from scam ICOs in 2017 to scam “DeFi” and “NFTs” on their Binance Smart Chain. \n\nThe point here is that FTX and SBF probably have numerous attack angles against Binance’s reputation and I also would not be the least surprised to see some shady stuff come to light with their order book, trade engine, liquidity, whatever. But we’ll never know because it’s Binance, and let’s be honest, any company with Chinese ties is a major transparency risk. Not to mention CZ is a Chinese citizen which technically means the CCP has him by the balls, if they ever choose.\n\n So my question here is- how does FTX/SBF struck back?\n\n2. Regulation- I wonder if US regulators are taking note of this situation. Will SBF’s donations pay off? Surely there has to be questions about the relationship between FTX and Alameda.\n\n3. Does FTT ever recover from this? How bad is the reputational damage?\n\n4. For those betting that FTX will weather this storm, it could be a good buying opportunity as the market overreacts.

To the assigned value of FTT by Alameda, we apply an additional significant discount to reflect the fact that this asset is associated with an affiliate company.\n \nWe then look at the financial position of Alameda based on this adjusted balance sheet (along with all of our normal credit underwriting requirements) to determine whether the company qualifies to be a borrower from Ledn.\n \nAfter taking all of this into consideration we continue to consider Alameda to be a strong credit.”",1667919105,t1_ivjejrk,/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/ypbpf1/daily_discussion_tuesday_november_08_2022/ivjwwko/

BitcoinMarkets,ivmnk8w,ypbpf1,So the funny thing is after doing more reading about the situation I actually think Sam wasn’t lying when he said they didn’t go invest client assets outside of the exchange. The liquidity crisis could have been entirely internal to ftx itself because of the bank run due to leverage.\n\nBasically all the people who deposited to stuff like ftx earn or who turned on margin lending were lending their assets to someone else on ftx. So user A deposits $1000 of USDT into ftx earn and user B borrows that $1000 with $1000 of their own money to go 2X long on BTC. Not a problem normally right? If user A wants their money back FTX probably has reserves and can cover the $1000 for user B and pay user A out.\n\nNow what happens when there’s a run on the exchange and every user A simultaneously wants their money back? The problem is that ftx can’t pay their withdrawal out unless they liquidate user B but they can’t just liquidate every user who has a leveraged position. \n\nMy guess is that FTX fucked up in a few different ways but basically they didn’t plan correctly for this scenario and was trying to have AR bail them out but the run was just too much.\n\nBasically it turns out those US regulations about capital requirements kinda make sense 😂\n\nThe real question now is whether this train wreck has more collateral damage due to AR leveraging against all those FTT.,1667958698,t1_ivm5rc4,/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/ypbpf1/daily_discussion_tuesday_november_08_2022/ivmnk8w/

It might be fair to say it's a once in a lifetime opportunity.  Don't eff it up.  Don't let fear cost you your future.\n\nFor anybody reading this who's scared today, here's my advice: Move your coins to a hardware wallet.  Secure your seed phrase and walk away for two years.  That'll put you six months-ish after the next halving, which means we'll be in the next major bull run.  When you come back, your investment will be worth so much more than the price you're panicking about today, and all of the old bears who sold will be wishing they were you, with your stack intact as Bitcoin soars to new highs only dreamt of during previous cycles.\n\nKEEP CALM    \nAND    \nHODL ON",1668026261,t3_yq93yq,/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/yq93yq/daily_discussion_wednesday_november_09_2022/ivq93ih/

Alts going up while BTC stagnates/declines = market is frothy and ripe for a dump. We have years of data proving that this is the case, unless anyone can point me to an altseason that didn't precede an epic market meltdown?\n\nETH is still almost 50% over its June lows. I'm short from 18K, I just hit my first TP at 16900. Moved stop to in profit @ 17.2. Next TP is at 16500 and from there 16000. If we hit sub 16K, I'll get greedy and cash the rest out at 14K.\n\nThe bear market is about to accelerate. Bitcoin dominance is at 38% LMFAO. That number probably needs to go up to end the bear market, but I can't remember the last time BTC price and dominance went up at the same time.\n\nSend it to 10K, send the dominance back over 50% and lets purge the shitcoiners from this fucking space please. Ridiculous how altseason manifested in the depths of the bear market, shitcoin gamblers thought BTC bottomed and used that as a justification to buy alts. The market won't recover until BTC starts leading again... too much shitcoinery.\n\nBTC ushered in the shitcoining era when it crossed 20K in Dec' 20. What's annoying is how the BTC-shitcoin relationship is really only positive in one direction; BTC, simply by existing, is a huge positive development for any shitcoin peddler. In the other direction, shitcoin have never led to positive BTC developments. The whole space and altcoin mania is due to leeching off the BTC momentum from each halving. Then, as altseason heats up, the bubble becomes unsustainable and the whole market falls on its face.\n\nWhen will investors start coming back to BTC? At what point do the shitcoiners see the market cap of BTC and think its an enticing play? Shitcoiners always said that BTC can't really gain much anymore once it passed a $1T market cap; that market cap is now $326B.\n\nReminder that every single coin in the top 10 (minus stables) is still way up over its June lows, except for Bitcoin. Why do you think that is the case? I'll tell you why: this has been a shitcoiners market for almost 2 years now. Reminder that BTC wiped out its entire bull run after December 2020.

At the end of the day money is great but I’ve known very wealthy people that had lives that ended in tragedy all the same, so focusing on your family and friends and personal physical and mental health is really much more important.

Will BlockFi liquidate the people in the $15,000s before Genesis can?

They were still solvent even if all the FTX tokens went to zero.\n\nPlus, given that most of the FTT tokens were valued on their sheet at $11, not $22, because they were ""locked,"" the losses from those tokens are significantly lower than if their balance sheet had fully valued them.\n\nAs to the lenders, we know that Genesis fully confirmed that they have survived in a tweet.  It's rumored that Ledn responded to support tickets stating that their loans were still overcollateralized and that Alameda is still responding to their requests; I'm trying to get that confirmation of survival in my own support ticket.  Nexo was able to get $110m out of FTX (why they had coins on an exchange makes no sense), and BlockFi is backed by a line of credit from [FTX.us](https://FTX.us), which did not fail and is subject to US regulations.\n\nI think that all the lenders will survive this incident.

BitcoinMarkets,ivnzb1k,yq93yq,"There are quite a few incorrect points here.\n\nThe US government doesn't forecast interest at 7% in 2025, so thats speculation. Secondly, countries in the eurozone, i.e. UK, have predicted interest peaks of \~5.25% in Q3 2023 and 4.x% in Q2 2024 (so declining in 2024). So peak inflation in 2023 (the eurozone is more substantially affected by the supply shortages & oil crisis than the US).\n\nThirdly [interest rates sharply recline during recessions](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS) which is forecasted to commence in 2023, again, backing these forecasts from monetary bodies.\n\nFourth, loans and bonds are increased by the base rate set by the monetary governing body. Short-term US T-bills track the interest rates, while longer term bills (5-10Y) have their projected principle value declined due to competition from new bonds. This is why the US02Y-US10Y bond yield curve is important for gauging market sentiment, and as it stands, 10 year bond yields are catching up and sharply increasing, suggested the interest rate growths is starting to slow already.\n\nFifth, yes and so do I. But that justifies the market bottom still being far away from here still.

There are relatively fixed costs, servers and employees. The trading engine of the site is a 'mature' product that basically runs itself.

And you're struggling. How?\n\nLike I've said, there are darknet markets which fundamentally run on a similar business model. Servers. Employees. Cut of every purchase. They didn't face insolvency.

BitcoinMarkets,ivs52zg,yr5tqr,"I'm with /u/thewardser and/or Bob Loukas on this one. I fully expect a near carbon copy of December 2018 sooner or later, a final true capitulation event down to $10K or similar. The CME gap meme, the psychologically-important $10K level, the 4-year cycle, the timing of FTX collapse, it's just too perfect.\n\nAt that point, people will start buying and holding for keeps. Holding 1 whole bitcoin will become distinctly possible for many people with that goal. And hopefully more people will stop storing coins on exchanges, stop the irresponsible leverage gambling, stop the shitcoin casino, stop looking for 'yield' in crypto entirely. Eight years ago, anyone in crypto purporting to offer interest on holdings was laughed off as a scammer. Any Bitcoin OG knows that they're still scammers.\n\nGensler and company really need to stop twiddling their thumbs if crypto is ever to be taken seriously. Force proof-of-reserves. Force stablecoin audits. Stop rejecting a spot Bitcoin ETF under the guise of protecting investors, while allowing shit like ShibaMarsElonIsGodCoin to exist. Deal with the whole 'unregistered securities' issue already. They've been sitting on their asses for *years* now with this. They're not anti-crypto, but they sit back and allow bad actors to rot the industry.\n\n2023 will play out like 2019, IMHO. A mini-bull run in the first half, or after the above capitulation event anyway, followed by a mini-bear run heading into the next halving.

Even exchanges you trust.  There are too many unknowns right now, so precaution is your best bet.\n\nGet a hardware wallet if you don't already have one.  I personally recommend a Ledger Nano S Plus (or a Trezor, though I have no experience with Trezor wallets.  Basically, buy a very well known product with a huge userbase.  Ledger or Trezor).\n\nIf you don't have experience with hardware wallets yet, buy one but don't use it immediately!  Spend a day messing with it.  Start with a new seed phrase even if you already have one, and spend time learning how it all works.  The point is to become as comfortable as possible before you use your own seed phrase on that wallet - and if you don't have a seed phrase yet, spend time experimenting with the first one the wallet randomly assigns you, **then wipe it out and start over with a new one**.\n\nAgain, the point is to learn the device thoroughly before you move your coins to it.  Learn, learn, learn.  Play with the software.  Dig through the menus.  LEARN.\n\nThe best time to protect yourself was the day you got started with Bitcoin...  but the next-best day is today.  So do it.  Your future self will thank you.\n\nTo me, the craziest part of the FTX collapse is how people watched Voyager collapse and thought it was a one time thing, even though it happened before and will happen again.

Now people are gonna go to jail because they broke the law. That’s where regulator step in. That’s the way it should be.\n\nShitcoins are largely non compliant companies getting around regulation by making it hard to find the scammers behind them. That’s most of crypto. And, frankly, the script kiddies working at these venture back shit shops are way more centralized than anyone wants to admit.\n\nThere aren’t 10 projects that are compliant. They simply don’t exist.\n\nBitcoin is not a security, so compliance is not an issue.

A better financial technology than bitcoin, perhaps some sort of electronic bank transfer system operating within legacy networks, would probably supersede cryptocurrency, leaving Monero as the only truly useful cryptocurrency.\n\nIf Genesis and BlockFi fail, which they will if Tether goes down, then I'll also be getting a job outside of crypto and not looking back.

I'm definitely emotionally invested, but I think my understanding of [Bitcoin's halving-to-halving cycles](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoHorde/comments/q604vq/lets_talk_market_cycles_yes_everybody_says_4q_is/hg9w79d/) gives me an overview of where we are and what comes next, broadly speaking.
